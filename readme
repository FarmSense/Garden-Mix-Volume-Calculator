Using it:

The badge is available as a hosted file at http://www.mediamesis.net/badges/volume_calc/volume_calc.min.js and is configurable by including json within the linking script tag.

For example, if you'd like the badge to appear in your right column. Simply add the following tag within your right column div or section:

<pre>
&lt;script src="http://www.mediamesis.net/badges/volume_calc/volume_calc.min.js"&gt;
	{"font":"Arial","width":"160px","padding":"40px 40px","margin":"10px 20px","bgcolor":"#efefef"}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

The script tag accepts font, width, margin, padding & background color paramets in standard CSS form, and the length, width & depth fields are used for calculating volume.
